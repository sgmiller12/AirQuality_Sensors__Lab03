thursday_data <- read_csv("thursday_data.csv")
tuesday_data <- read_csv("tuesday_data.csv")

### Basic analysis of thursday data
th_combined_means <- thursday_data %>%
  group_by(location, sensor) %>%
  summarize(th_mean_measurement = mean(pm_25),
            th_mean_sd = sd(pm_25))
View(th_combined_means)

ggplot(data = th_combined_means, aes(x = sensor, y = th_mean_measurement, color = location)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "sensor",
     y = "mean PM2.5 ",
     title = "PM2.5 Measurements for Thursday") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=th_mean_measurement-th_mean_sd, ymax=th_mean_measurement+th_mean_sd)) + 
  facet_wrap(~location)

### same thing but for tuesday data
tu_combined_means <- tuesday_data %>%
  group_by(location, sensor) %>%
  summarize(tu_mean_measurement = mean(pm_25),
            tu_mean_sd = sd(pm_25))

ggplot(data = tu_combined_means, aes(x = sensor, y = tu_mean_measurement, color = location)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "sensor",
     y = "mean PM2.5 ",
     title = "PM2.5 Measurements for Tuesday") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=tu_mean_measurement-tu_mean_sd, ymax=tu_mean_measurement+tu_mean_sd)) + 
  facet_wrap(~location)

### experimenting with grouping locations by north/south of canyon for tuesday data
tu_combined_means <- tuesday_data %>%
  group_by(sensor,location) %>%
  summarize(tu_mean_measurement = mean(pm_25),
            tu_mean_sd = sd(pm_25)) 
tu_direction <- mutate(tu_combined_means, direction = ifelse((sensor == "3" | sensor == "5" |sensor == "10" |sensor == "11" |sensor == "19"),"North","South"))
tu_direction


ggplot(data = tu_direction, aes(x = sensor, y = tu_mean_measurement, color = direction)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Sensor",
     y = "mean PM2.5 ",
     title = "PM2.5 Measurements on Tuesday") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=tu_mean_measurement-tu_mean_sd, ymax=tu_mean_measurement+tu_mean_sd)) + 
  facet_wrap(~location) 

### Same for thursday data
th_combined_means <- thursday_data %>%
  group_by(sensor,location) %>%
  summarize(th_mean_measurement = mean(pm_25),
            th_mean_sd = sd(pm_25)) 
th_direction <- mutate(th_combined_means, direction = ifelse((sensor == "3" | sensor == "5" |sensor == "10" |sensor == "11" |sensor == "19"),"North","South"))

ggplot(data = th_direction, aes(x = sensor, y = th_mean_measurement, color = direction)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Sensor",
     y = "mean PM2.5 ",
     title = "PM2.5 Measurements on Thursday") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=th_mean_measurement-th_mean_sd, ymax=th_mean_measurement+th_mean_sd)) + 
  facet_wrap(~location) 

### means and sd for North vs South 
tu_direction_means <- tu_direction %>%
  group_by(direction,location) %>%
  summarize(tu_dir_mean_measurement = mean(tu_mean_measurement),
            tu_dir_mean_sd = sd(tu_mean_measurement))
tu_direction_means

ggplot(data = tu_direction_means, aes(x = direction, y = tu_dir_mean_measurement, color = direction)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Sensor",
     y = "mean PM2.5 ",
     title = "PM2.5 Measurements on Tuesday") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=tu_dir_mean_measurement-tu_dir_mean_sd, ymax=tu_dir_mean_measurement+tu_dir_mean_sd)) + 
  facet_wrap(~location) 

th_direction_means <- th_direction %>%
  group_by(direction,location) %>%
  summarize(th_dir_mean_measurement = mean(th_mean_measurement),
            th_dir_mean_sd = sd(th_mean_measurement))
th_direction_means

ggplot(data = th_direction_means, aes(x = direction, y = th_dir_mean_measurement, color = direction)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Sensor",
     y = "mean PM2.5 ",
     title = "PM2.5 Measurements on Thursday") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=th_dir_mean_measurement-th_dir_mean_sd, ymax=th_dir_mean_measurement+th_dir_mean_sd)) + 
  facet_wrap(~location)
